AI Usage Documentation for A2 Loyalty API Project

I used AI assistance for the following aspects of this project:

1. CODE GENERATION AND IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Used AI to help implement the Prisma database schema with proper relationships
   - Generated comprehensive seed data for testing all endpoints
   - Created validation functions for utorid (7-8 chars alphanumeric) and pagination
   - Implemented business logic for cashier promotion with suspicious flag handling
   - Generated error handling middleware and standardized response formats

2. TESTING AND VALIDATION:
   - Used AI to create comprehensive route-level tests and assertions
   - Generated test cases for all validation functions
   - Created automated regression testing to prevent future issues
   - Implemented business logic assertions for cashier promotion rules

3. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Used AI to generate comprehensive documentation for the seed system
   - Created Postman collection with critical flows
   - Generated HTTP test files for endpoint testing
   - Created requirements implementation documentation

4. CODE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION:
   - Used AI to help organize the codebase into proper service/controller/middleware layers
   - Generated centralized error handling system
   - Created role-based access control implementation
   - Implemented proper validation and business logic separation

5. DEBUGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - Used AI to help debug Prisma schema issues
   - Generated solutions for JWT authentication problems
   - Created comprehensive error handling for edge cases
   - Implemented proper database relationship management

The AI was used primarily as a supplementary tool for:
- Code structure and organization
- Implementation of complex business logic
- Testing framework development
- Documentation generation
- Debugging assistance

All code was reviewed, tested, and understood before submission. The AI helped with implementation details but the overall architecture and business requirements were understood and implemented according to the assignment specifications.

The final codebase represents my understanding of the requirements and proper implementation of the loyalty API system.
