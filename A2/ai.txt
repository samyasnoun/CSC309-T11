I used AI assistance (Claude via Cursor) to help debug and fix failing test cases in this assignment.

The AI helped with:
- Identifying validation issues in controllers
- Fixing status code logic for events, promotions, and transactions
- Creating the optionalAuth middleware for public endpoints
- Debugging schema compliance issues in API responses
- Improving error handling and input validation

All code was reviewed and tested by me before submission.
