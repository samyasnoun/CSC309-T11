I used AI (Claude/Cursor) to assist with this assignment in the following ways:

1. Debugging and fixing test case failures
2. Understanding Prisma query syntax and SQLite compatibility
3. Implementing proper authentication middleware and route protection
4. Fixing validation logic for user updates and transaction creation
5. Resolving permission issues across controllers
6. Code review and bug identification

The AI helped identify issues, suggest fixes, and explain best practices, but I reviewed and understood all changes before applying them.
